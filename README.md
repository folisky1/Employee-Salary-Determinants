# OVERVIEW

This project explores the various factors that shape an employee's earning potential, delving into the key determinants such as education level, job role, experience, etc. By analyzing these elements, we aim to uncover valuable insights and offer actionable recommendations to help employees enhance their earning potential.

# DATA SOURCE

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle

# RESULTS

1. The analysis reveals that individuals in the 51-62 age group earn the highest median salary, amounting to $190,000. This suggests that with increasing age, empoloyees tend to earn more, possibly due to accumulated experience and seniority.
   
2. The data shows that male employees command a higher median salary of $120,000 compared to their female counterparts, who earn $105,000. This suggests that gender-based compensation disparities exist in the workplace.
 
3. The data reveals that individuals with advanced degrees, including doctoral and master's degrees, command the highest median salaries. This highlights the potential salary benefits of acquiring these qualifications.
   
4. The analysis indicates that CEOs and Chief Technology Officers earn the highest salaries. This pattern suggests that executive and leadership roles offer the best salary opportunities.
   
5. The data shows that top earners predominantly hold master's and doctoral degrees. This finding indicates that advanced degrees like these often lead to higher incomes.

6. There is a very strong correlation (r = 0.94) between age and years of experience. This underscores the premise that, as individuals age, their reservoir of experience tends to grow considerably.
Additionally, we identified a strong correlation (r = 0.82) between salary and years of experience. This suggests a trend where greater years of experience translate into higher salary prospects.
Furthermore, a strong correlation (r = 0.77) exists between age and salary. This trend implies that age positively influences salary, potentially owing to the accumulation of extensive professional experience and expertise over the years


# Recommendation
1. Employees should continue to accumulate experience and knowledge in their fields. They should also seek out opportunities for career growth and advancement, which often lead to higher earning potential over time

2. The organization should adopt transparent compensation policies and actively monitor and address any gender-based pay disparities.

3. Employees should consider pursuing advanced degrees to boost their earning potential in today's competitive job market.

4. Employees should strive to attain top-level positions to boost their earning potential.

5. Employees are encouraged to pursue advanced degrees to unlock opportunities for higher-paying positions and increase their earning potential

6. Employees should proactively seek opportunities to gain valuable work experience to enhance their earning potential.


# CONCLUSION

In this project, we've revealed the essential factors shaping salary prospects and offered practical recommendations. Implementing these suggestions can help individuals secure higher salaries and additional employee benefits.
